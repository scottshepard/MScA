## Prompt

This assignment is dependent on completion of previous assignment. 
Objective of this project is to forecast CME seat prices using CME trading
volume.

Now that you have a monthly time series of CME seat prices, the file
`Contracts_Volume.csv` contains the monthly trading volume for 
different CME products.  

Each row has the first date of the following month (the trade volume is 
for the month), the commodity indicator for CME, the short description of 
the commodity, whether it is Future (F) or Option (O), 
the electronic trading volume and the total trading volume. 
The floor trading volume is the difference between the total 
volume and the electronic volume.

The file `Contracts_Classification.csv` associates each CME commodity 
with a seat class.

Note that owning a CME seat gives a trader advantage for floor trading.
In contrast, owning a CME seat does not have any advantage for electronic
trading. Since electronic trading constitutes market participants trading
directly with other participants via CME's network connections and order
matching engine.

There are three classes of seats CME, IMM, and IOM which confer the 
rights to trade different sets of commodities traded. 
CME seat owners can trade everything, IMM seat owners are allowed to 
trade all futures and options except agricultural products, 
and IOM seat owners are allowed to trade future and options 
only in index products and all other CME options.

To find the volume, for example index products, add both the 
futures and options volume for the same index product for a month.

 
Your task is to use the trading volume information to forecast the CME
monthly seat price for 2013.  It is recommended to do exploratory data
analysis to find initial data relationships such as correlations. For
example, the total trade volume for all CME products might be a good
predictor for CME seat class, but not for the others. 
You may have to choose and select which commodities have influence on 
the IMM and IOM seat prices.

The tasks are outlined below.

Task A:

Use the following algorithms:

- Linear regression (seat price is independent, volume(s) dependent)
- Linear regression with ARMA errors (use arima with xreg)
- Holt Winters
- ARIMA
- Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) - here seasonality is monthly
- Fractional ARIMA (ARFIMA) - check applicability first using the ACF
- ARMA and GARCH combination - use the fGarch R library and garchFit()

Note that you have to implement each of the above algorithms for each of the 3 classes of seats: CME, IMM, IOM. 

Task B:

Since you already have the seat prices for the 2013,
evaluate each algorithm from Task A using sMAPE. 
Which one do you recommend to forecast monthly prices for each of the seat classes?

## Contract Volume Data

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(stringr)

cv <- read.csv("~/Datasets/31006/Contracts_Volume.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)
cc <- read.csv("~/Datasets/31006/Contracts_Classification.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)

cv$Electronic.Volume <- str_replace_all(cv$Electronic.Volume, ',', '')
cv$Electronic.Volume <- as.numeric(cv$Electronic.Volume)
cv$Floor.Volume <- cv$Total.Volume - cv$Electronic.Volume

df = merge(cv, cc, 
           by.x='Commodity.Indicator', by.y='Commodity.Code', all.x=T)

df$Date <- as.Date(df$Date, '%m/%d/%Y')
df$yearmon <- as.yearmon(df$Date)

monthly_vol <- df %>% 
  group_by(yearmon, Division) %>%
  summarize(ev = sum(Electronic.Volume), 
            tv = sum(Total.Volume), 
            fv=sum(Floor.Volume))

ggplot(monthly_vol, aes(x=yearmon, y=fv, color=Division)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(title='Monthly Floor Volume at the Merch',
       y='Floor Volume', x='Time')
```

```{r}

    filter(monthly_vol, Division=='CME')[,c('yearmon', 'fv')], 
    on='yearmon', all.x=T)

head(ts_cmeS)
```

## Task A: Fit Models

### Linear Regression 

Seat price is independent, Volume dependent

```{r}
lm_cme <- lm(spline ~ fv, data=ts_cmeS)

summary(lm_cme)

ggplot(ts_cmeS, aes(x=fv, y=spline)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm') + 
  labs('')

ts_cmeS %>%
  melt(id.vars='yearmon', measure.vars = c('fv', 'spline')) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=yearmon, y=value, color=variable)) + 
  geom_line()
```
