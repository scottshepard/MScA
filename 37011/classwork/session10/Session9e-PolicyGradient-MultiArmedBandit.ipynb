    "In probability theory, the multi-armed bandit problem (sometimes called the K-[1] or N-armed bandit problem[2]) is a problem in which a gambler at a row of slot machines (sometimes known as \"one-armed bandits\") has to decide which machines to play, how many times to play each machine and in which order to play them.[3] When played, each machine provides a random reward from a probability distribution specific to that machine. The objective of the gambler is to maximize the sum of rewards earned through a sequence of lever pulls.[4][5]"
