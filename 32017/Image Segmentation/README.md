# MScA 32017 Advanced Machine Learning - Image Segmentaion Project

This project involves training a UNet Neural Network on a series of satellite
images to classify pixels in the images into one of five classes: trees, crops,
roads, buidlings, or water.

The four IPython notebooks were provided by the instructor. 
They show:
  1. [The basics of image segmentation](MScA_32017_ImageSegmentation1_Basics.ipynb)
  2. [What the training images look like and how to manipulate them](MScA_32017_ImageSegmentation2_DataExploration.ipynb)
  3. [How to build and train a UNet](MScA_32017_ImageSegmentation3_UNetSimple.ipynb)
  4. [Project insructions](MScA_32017_ImageSegmentation4_ProjectInstructions.ipynb)
